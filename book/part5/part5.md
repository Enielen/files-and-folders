# Part 5 - Conclusion

### 5a. Exit quiz:

This module aimed to provide information, examples, and practice opportunities so that you develop the skills to...

- Recognise the importance of file and folder organisation and relate it to your studies.

- Use appropriate naming conventions to manage project files systemically.

- Structure folders effectively to make elements of a research project findable for collaborators and for your future self.

- Explain the concept of a directory tree.

- Evaluate whether to store a file locally vs. remotely based on factors such as accessibility, security, and collaboration needs.

Please take a brief exit quiz as a final check for understanding on these skills and concepts.
